# :bear: Bear_Annoyer
A project hosted 24/7 and made with the sole purpose of annoying a random stranger on the Internet that I don't like, because he asks the most stupid questions and shows a shitty attitude to the people who help him with his coding issues. So I've made this Bear Annoyer just to irritate him and push his endless stream of questions up and beyond the field of vision of anyone who might be kind enough to help an ungrateful jerk like him.

Made out of spite, a couple hours of work and an energy-replenishing packet of chocolate milk.

No thank you to Mr Bear, I could've been doing something else but nooo you had to make me do this.
